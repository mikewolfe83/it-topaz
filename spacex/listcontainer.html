                                <li>* DELIVERY AND RETURN SERVICES - Dragon is the first commercial spacecraft to deliver cargo to the International Space Station and currently the only cargo spacecraft flying capable of returning significant amounts of cargo to Earth.</li> 
                                <li>*Dragon accommodates pressurized cargo in the capsule as well as unpressurized cargo in its trunk.</li>
                                <li>* VERSATILE CARGO RACKS - The racks are a honeycomb carbon-aluminum construction designed for efficient packing in a zero-gravity environment. </li>
                                <li>They accommodate a variety of standard-size NASA cargo bags as well as freezers for carrying materials such as biological samples.</li>

                                <li>* PARTNERSHIP WITH NASA - Dragon was designed from the outset to fly humans to space. </li>
                                <li>* Under an agreement with NASA, SpaceX is making upgrades to Dragon to allow for crew carrying capability. </li>
                                <li>* CREW UPGRADES - Dragon will be the world’s safest and most reliable crew transport vehicle, with seating for seven, life-support systems, controls with manual capability, and a powered launch escape system.</li>
                                <li>* FIRST LAUNCH - Upgrades to Dragon are currently in progress. </li>
                                <li>* Dragon’s first manned test flight is expected to take place as early as 2018.</li>
